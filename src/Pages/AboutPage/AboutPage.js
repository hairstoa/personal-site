                    <p>
                    Adriane is a developer born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA. 
                    In December 2021, she graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor's of Computer Science Degree. 
                    She began programming through a curiosity in open source software that improves the qualities of peopleâ€™s lives at no additional cost.
                    Another interest is developing software that raises environmental awareness and helps people interact with the planet more consciously.
                    Adriane was part of a small team that won the BeaverHacks Fall 2021 Hackathon focused on climate/energy with a drought tracking web application.

                    The children's book she illustrated, "Have You Seen Green?" by Keith Canedo, was published in 2020 and it encourages environmental activism.
